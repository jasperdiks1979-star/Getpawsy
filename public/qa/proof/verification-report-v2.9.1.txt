Fix: Server-Rendered Category Routes Fix

ISSUE:
Browser requests to /small-pets, /dogs, /cats were being intercepted by the
SPA fallback in server.js instead of being handled by the EJS-based routes.

ROOT CAUSE:
The isServerRendered check in server.js line 1404 did not include these paths,
so the SPA fallback served public/index.html (homepage) instead of allowing
the redirect to /collection/* routes.

FIX APPLIED:
Added /small-pets, /dogs, /cats to isServerRendered check in server.js:

  const isServerRendered = req.path.startsWith("/product/") || 
                           req.path.startsWith("/collection/") ||
                           req.path.startsWith("/small-pets") ||
                           req.path.startsWith("/dogs") ||
                           req.path.startsWith("/cats") ||
                           req.path.startsWith("/c/") || 
                           req.path.startsWith("/admin");

PRODUCTION TEST RESULTS (https://getpawsy.pet):
-----------------------------------------------
| Route         | Redirects To              | Products | Status |

| /small-pets   | /collection/small-pets    | 129      | PASS   |
| /dogs         | /collection/dogs          | 259      | PASS   |
| /cats         | /collection/cats          | 186      | PASS   |
